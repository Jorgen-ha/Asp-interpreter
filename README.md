# Making an Asp interpreter
The programming language **Asp** bears a lot of resemblance to Python, though it is much smaller (like the relationship between the two types of snakes üêç).

This project tasked us with creating an interpreter using Java, with a strong focus on object oriented programming. 
The full compendium can be found in `Asp-compendium.pdf`, as it was provided for the project. 

The final product was able to correctly interpret code written in Asp, which included error handling, logging, input verification and syntax.
